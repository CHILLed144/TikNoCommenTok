A very basic Chrome extension to hide the TikTok comment section.

## Why? Here's the story 📜
One evening, a friend suggested playing a game based on videos from a TikToker. Each TikTok from this user featured videos that simulated a choose-your-own-adventure horror story, where various choices could be made, but only one sequence of choices led to the team's survival. 
However, in the comments, everyone would write if and how they won, and since we didn't want any spoilers, I created this extension to hide the comments section with a click.
