# (Tik)NoCommenT(ok) 🚫🗨️
A very basic Chrome extension to **hide the TikTok comment section.**

## Why? Here's the story 📜
_One evening, a friend suggested playing a game based on videos from a TikToker. Each TikTok from this user featured videos that simulated a choose-your-own-adventure horror story, where various choices could be made, but only one sequence of choices led to the team's survival._

However, in the comments everyone would write if and how they won, and since we didn't want any spoilers, I created this extension to **hide the comments section with a click**.

## How it works? 🤔
When the **extension icon is clicked**, it searches for the **HTML element** that usually contains the **comment section** and toggles its **hidden property**.

### Installation ⬇️✔️
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select this project's folder.
5. Pin the extension and try it out!
